# Brahms

Brahms is a command line utility written in Go that quickly generates good-looking visuals of midi-files.

It is inspired by [Off the staff](https://www.c82.net/offthestaff/) by Nicholas Rougeux.

Feel free to open PRs, issues, etc. I'm glad to help.

## Example

Below you can see an example of Beethoven's Symphony Nr. 9 (at least i think so, I can't remember exactly ü§∑‚Äç):

Generated some other nice visualisation? Share it [here](https://github.com/Wulfheart/brahms/issues/new?assignees=&labels=showcase&template=showcase.md&title=) with the world in the project's showcase.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have installed [midicsv](https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/) and made it available in your ``PATH`` variable so you can call it directly from the command-line.

You can test your midicsv installation by calling ``midicsv -u`` in your console. The expected output has to be similar to this:

```
Usage: Your\Path\Where\It\Is\Midicsv.exe [ options ] [ midi_file ] [ csv_file ]
       Options:
           -u            Print this message
           -v            Verbose: dump header and track information
Version 1.1 (January 2008)
```

### with go tools (works on all OS)

```
go install github.com/Wulfheart/brahms
```

### Windows

1. Download the latest ``.exe`` release [here](https://github.com/Wulfheart/brahms/releases).
